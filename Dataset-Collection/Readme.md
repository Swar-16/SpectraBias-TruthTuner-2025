📊 Dataset Curation: How We Did It
We curated our own dataset from scratch to ensure relevance, diversity, and balance across different political orientations. Here's a brief on how we approached it:

- Web Scraping: Collected articles from a carefully selected list of Indian news websites across the political spectrum.
- Filtering: Cleaned and filtered the content based on publication sections (e.g., politics), recency, and language.
- Manual Labeling: Articles were labeled by considering:
  - Source bias profiles from trusted third-party organizations
  - Headline and language tone analysis
  - Multiple annotator cross-checks to ensure label integrity
- Text Preprocessing: Removed boilerplate text, tokenized, normalized (lowercasing, stopword removal), and vectorized.
- Balancing: Used under/oversampling techniques to maintain class balance.

⚠️ Note: Due to ethical and legal considerations, we have not made the dataset publicly available in this repository.

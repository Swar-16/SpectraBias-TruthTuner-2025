In October 2017, President Donald Trump directed that the opioid crisis be declared a public health emergency. In India, Punjab is one of the hotbeds of drug abuse. A PIL recently filed in the Punjab and Haryana High Court asked that an opioid substitute, Buprenorphine, be made available on a \\u201clong-term basis\\u201d to help drug addicts. The PIL, filed by Samaj Bachao Mission Committee, a Tarn Taran-based NGO, said: \\u201cIn Punjab, less than 10% of drug addicts have received opioid substitution therapy (OST). The proper procedure for the treatment. endorsed by the United Nations and the World Health Organisation, is providing opioid medication like Buprenorphine. on a long-term basis.\\u201d What is Buprenorphine? It is an opioid drug used to treat pain and addiction. It is the main drug in OST, which is often used with Naloxone. The treatment involves doctor-administered doses of Buprenorphine under controlled circumstances. According to doctors, the drug can play a major role in rehabilitating addicts if used under medical supervision along with psychosocial interventions. But there are risks \\u2014 patients may get addicted to Buprenorphine, and start consuming it in non-medical environments. If injected along with depressant drugs, this can even lead to death. Is it commonly available in pharmacies? Buprenorphine is a Schedule H drug and is available at government-recognised pharmacies only. But in 2014, the Punjab government \\u2014 which had ordered a high-profile crackdown on drug peddlers \\u2014 placed further restrictions on it. Said Kaustubh Sharma, who was until recently zonal director of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in Chandigarh: \\u201cSuddenly, there was a boom in the demand for Buprenorphine as addicts found the drug to be an alternative.\\u201d Private psychiatrists had started prescribing the drug in excessive quantity to addicts, and it was being sold as an alternative to heroin. \\u201cThe government issued orders to restrict its supply after there were reports of misuse and illegal sale. Its availability was restricted to government and private rehabilitation centres only,\\u201d Punjab\\u2019s Drug Controller Pardeep Kumar Mattu said. So, how severe is Punjab\\u2019s drug problem? This has been an issue of political controversy. Studies have come up with varying numbers. But it is estimated that the state has between 1.7 lakh and 2.7 lakh addicts. What is the current Congress government\\u2019s view on Buprenorphine? In its election campaign, the Congress had promised to end the drug menace, not only through policing, but also by medical interventions. Kanwar Ajit Singh Sidhu, an NRI drug therapist based in the United States, helped the state government chalk out a plan. He proposed a Buprenorphine-based Outpatient Opioid Assisted Treatment (OOAT) programme. Following Chief Minister Amarinder Singh\\u2019s order to set up a committee to study the proposal, the government introduced the OOAT model in October on a pilot basis in three districts (Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Moga). Buprenorphine is currently administered in four rehabilitation and 21 community health centres in the state. How freely is Buprenorphine available in other states across the country? Buprenorphine is sold under strict regulations and cannot be purchased without the prescription of a qualified doctor. It is listed as a psychotropic substance under The Narcotic Drugs Psychotropic Substances Act. Does OST enjoy wider support? Atul Ambekar, a professor at the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre at AIIMS, New Delhi, is one of its supporters. \\u201cAt the moment, the availability of this treatment (OST) is low. This needs to be improved. There is a large section of opioid-dependent people who are suffering due to the unavailability of OST,\\u201d Dr Ambekar told The Indian Express. So who opposes the treatment? Some experts suggest that extra caution must be adopted while conducting OST. \\u201cNo one can doubt that OST is the most evidence-based therapy. But the treatment should be recovery-oriented. Patients should not be mindlessly given the drug,\\u201d said Dr D Basu, a professor at PGIMER, Chandigarh. He referred to the misuse of Buprenorphine in Punjab in 2014 as an example. What is the result of OOAT in Punjab? As of mid-January 2018, 1,712 new patients were registered in the three districts where the pilot is running. Health officials said that 1,406 patients had visited the centres, and the patient retention rate currently stands at 82.13%. \\u201cOnly after the doctors diagnose the patients for opioid dependence, a call is taken on the line of treatment,\\u201d said Ranbir Singh Rana, in-charge of the Tarn Taran drug de-addiction facility. Punjab\\u2019s Health Minister Brahm Mohindra said a call on expanding the project to other districts will be taken after studying the success of the pilot programme. Is there a debate on Buprenorphine in other countries as well? In his first State of the Union address, President Donald Trump said the country in 2016 \\u201clost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per day. Seven per hour.\\u201d Last month, the US Drug Enforcement Administration allowed more healthcare professionals to prescribe and dispense Buprenorphine from their offices.\",\n          \"The Delhi Directorate of Education (DoE) has declared the results of the first computerised draw of lots for Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and Disadvantaged Group (DG) category admissions for the 2025-26 academic session. The draw, held on March 5 at 2.30pm, is part of the enrollment process for private unaided recognised schools across Delhi.Fair And Transparent Admission ProcessThe computerised lottery system is designed to ensure transparency and fairness in the admission process. The event was overseen by DoE officials, school representatives, and other stakeholders to maintain the integrity of the draw. This initiative is a key component of the Delhi government's efforts to provide equitable access to quality education for children from economically and socially disadvantaged backgrounds.Admission Process Under EWS/DG QuotaUnder the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 25% of seats in private unaided recognized schools are reserved for students from EWS and DG categories. The lottery-based selection process aims to provide an equal opportunity to all eligible applicants, promoting inclusivity in Delhi's education system.How To Check Delhi School EWS Result 2025Parents and guardians can check the EWS/DG admission results by following these steps:Go to the official DoE website, edudel.nic.in.Select the 'EWS/DG Admission Result 2025-26' link.Enter the child's application number and date of birth.Submit the details to view the admission result.The screen will show the selection status and the allotted school.Download and print the result for future reference.Next Steps For Selected CandidatesThose who have secured seats through the draw must complete the admission formalities within the specified timeframe. Required documents include proof of income, residence, and the child's birth certificate. Missing the deadline may result in the cancellation of the allotted seat.What To Do If Not SelectedParents whose children were not selected in the first draw should remain hopeful. Depending on seat availability, the DoE may conduct additional rounds of the draw. It is important to monitor official notifications for updates on subsequent opportunities.\",\n          \"Amid missiles and ceasefire violations, Pakistan has unleashed an equally dangerous offensive: a disinformation campaign on social media aimed at sowing confusion, stoking fear and manipulating sentiment. Following India\\u2019s successful precision strikes under Operation Sindoor, a coordinated digital onslaught has been seen on social media platforms.Spearheaded by pro-Pakistan accounts and amplified by state media outlets and even some verified handles of Pakistani politicians, the campaign appears to be designed to distort facts, shift narratives and mask Islamabad's military provocations. Here are some of the disinformation posts being widely shared on or around May 10:False claims of Pakistan destroying India's S-400 missile systemsAmongst the most glaring fabrications is the claim that Pakistan's JF-17 fighter jets fired hypersonic missiles to destroy an Indian S-400 air defence system stationed in Adampur, Punjab. The information, initially propagated by Pakistan\\u2019s state-run broadcaster PTV and picked up by China\\u2019s Xinhua news agency via Global Times, was categorically denied by Indian defence officials.The Press Information Bureau\\u2019s Fact-Check Unit also issued a statement on X, dismissing the viral posts. \\u201cPosts circulating on social media claim that Pakistan has destroyed an Indian S-400 air defence system. This claim is FAKE. Reports of destruction or any damage to an S-400 system are baseless,\\u201d PIB said in a post.Wrong claim of IAF female pilot being capturedIn another case of misinformation being shared widely by several Pakistan-based accounts on social media, it was claimed that a female Indian Air Force pilot was captured in Pakistan. PIB has debunked this false claim on its account as well.\\u201cPro-Pakistan social media handles claim that an Indian Female Air Force pilot, Squadron Leader Shivani Singh, has been captured in Pakistan. This is false claim,\\u201d PIB said in another post on X.False claim of 70% electricity grid hit by Pakistan\\u2019s cyberattackAlso debunked were assertions of a large-scale cyberattack allegedly launched by Pakistan, which purportedly shut down 70% of India's electricity grid.\\u201cSocial media posts are asserting that a cyber attack by Pakistan has caused 70% of India's electricity grid to become dysfunctional. This claim is false,\\u201d PIB reiterated, urging citizens to remain vigilant and verify news from official sources.Wrong claim of 3 IAF jets crashing in HimalayasSeveral other social media posts are going around claiming that as many as three fighter jets of the Indian Air Force crashed in the Himalayan region. PIB also debunked this post as completely false in its fact check\\\"Attention: False Claim Circulating Online! Several pro-Pakistan social media accounts are falsely claiming that three fighter jets have crashed in different areas of the Himalayan region,\\\" PIB said in an X post.False claim of India attacking Nankana Sahib gurdwara in PakistanIn another widely circulated piece of disinformation, videos emerged alleging that India had carried out a drone strike on the Nankana Sahib gurdwara in Pakistan, a sacred site revered by Sikhs globally. The Government of India, through its PIB\\u2019s Fact Check Unit, dismissed the claim as entirely fabricated.\\\"A video shared on social media is claiming that India has carried out a drone attack on the Nankhana Sahib gurdwara.

Air pollution has become a growing concern in many parts of the world, including India, where urbanization and industrialization have led to deteriorating air quality in several cities. The situation especially worsens around the festive season in India, which is October. While the rest of the country finds it difficult to even breathe, some cities are relatively cleaner in terms of pollution. One of the major indicators of pollution in places is the AQI or its Air Quality Index. The lesser the AQI, the cleaner the place is. Around the globe, cities and countries are classified into three categories when it comes to the level of AQI, they are Good, moderate and poor. While some Indian cities are notorious for always getting placed in the list of most polluted cities in the world, there are others who are doing exceptionally well. The data in this article has been taken from a site called AQI, which is the first of its kind in India and reflects real time numbers on its website. Let us explore the Indian cities with the classification of \\u2018Good\\u2019, based on their AQI numbers.With an AQI(IN) of 5, Bishnupur tops the list of least polluted cities in India. This small town is situated some 27 Kms away from Imphal City on Tiddim Road.Another town situated in Manipur is at the top of the list. Kakching, was declared as the cleanest city in North East India by the Swachh Bharat Mission of the Indian government, in 2018.Imphal, the capital of Manipur, has an AQI(IN) of 7, which is the third best in the country. The city is surrounded by 9 hills, which helps keep the air of the Imphal clean.The capital of Mizoram, which is also its most populous city has an AQI(IN) of 8, which is classified as \\u2018Good\\u2019. It is situated atop a series of ridges, and has an average elevation of around 1,132 meters above sea level.Channarayapatna is a town, situated in the district of Hassan, Karnataka. It has a current AQI(IN) of 11. Its current PM2.5 is also below the recommended limit given by the WHO.Silchar, situated in Assam has an air quality index of 11. Located some 340 kilometers from Guwahati, silachar is the second most populated city in the state.

But experts say the effectiveness of these stringent measures hinges on trusting children to voluntarily identify themselves as minors, highlighting fundamental challenges in protecting young users online while preserving accessibility and privacy.Also Read | Children below 18 will need parents' consent to create social media account: Draft rules\\u201cThe fundamental question is - what happens if I don\\u2019t give my correct age? How will the entire mechanism work?\\u201d asked technology lawyer Gowree Gokhale, highlighting the core challenge facing India\\u2019s new data protection framework.Under Section 9 of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, data fiduciaries must obtain \\u201cverifiable consent\\u201d from parents or lawful guardians before processing data of anyone under 18. The section also prohibits processing data that could harm children, targeting them with ads, or tracking their behaviour. For not complying with these obligations, the Data Protection Board can impose penalties of up to \\u20b9200 crore. While the framework is comprehensive, its implementation begins with a crucial weakness: self-declaration.\\u201cThis typically may not work as who will say no to it, thereby failing the government\\u2019s stated objective of providing a safe online environment for children,\\u201d noted Aprajita Rana, partner at AZB & Partners. \\u201cThe only scenario where this works is if the parent is either sitting with the child as the account is created, or creates the account on their behalf.\\u201dThe other significant problem with this regime is that it assumes that parents are always more digitally literate than their children and can give informed consent on behalf of their children. \\u201cOur research has shown that digital literacy imbalance exists within families where children show higher digital literacy than parents and operate basic digital services like payment services,\\u201d Siddharth P, co-founder of Rati Foundation, an NGO that runs a helpline for online safety, said.The draft rules represent one of the world\\u2019s most stringent approaches to protecting children\\u2019s data, requiring parental consent for users under 18. The United States\\u2019 Children\\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) defines a child as someone under the age of 13 years while Europe\\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) allows member states to define age of digital consent between 13 and 16.Even major platforms have acknowledged the inherent challenges in age verification and the trade-offs made between effective age verification and the principle of data minimisation. Meta\\u2019s global head of Safety, Antigone Davis, speaking to HT in November, had described it as \\u201ca challenge for the entire industry\\u201d where \\u201cno age mechanisms work perfectly.\\u201d Instagram\\u2019s current approach combines multiple methods - from basic age declarations to photo IDs and video selfies - and even analyses public posts for age-related signals, such as birthday wishes that might contradict stated age. However, Meta had sought exemptions to use behavioural data for age assessment of children, something the proposed rules only permit for verifying adulthood.Siddharth pointed out that age gating may also lead to tradeoffs between digital access and privacy on the one hand, and security on the other. \\u201cDigital divide is prevalent in India, especially along gender lines. Our research shows that girls get much less access to digital services and devices. Age gating codifies permission-seeking behaviour that is a social expectation in girls. So when such mechanisms come into place, there is surveillance within the family as well. This could lead to exclusion of girls from digital spaces,\\u201d he said.Technical challengeAge gating, the process of restricting access to services based on age, can range from simple pop-ups requiring users to confirm their age to complex age verification systems involving government IDs or facial scanning and biometrics.For verifiable parental consent, platforms must accomplish four tasks: determine if the user is a child, verify an adult\\u2019s identity, establish the relationship between them, and retain a record of the adult\\u2019s consent.Under the proposed rules, experts agree that the identity of the child will not have to be established even as all DFs must determine whether every user is above or under 18 years of age. The relationship between the child and parent also does not need to be established, thereby defeating the point of verifiable parental consent. Both the identity and the age of the adult in question, however, need to be established.Once a user declares themselves to be a child, the need for verifiable parental consent will kick in. This process creates multiple paths and challenges.For major platforms like Facebook, existing adult users\\u2019 data could verify parental identity. But smaller platforms face a heavier burden, needing to either collect government IDs or integrate with third-party digital locker service providers (DLSPs) as proposed in the DPDP Rules.\\u201cBig Tech does have an advantage here. It might be harder for smaller data fiduciaries to adopt these measures and access DLSPs as they will need more robust security measures, leading to lags in the short term, though overall this is good for user privacy,\\u201d Rana noted. The disparity raises concerns about competition and implementation feasibility.The government has acknowledged these challenges. In a July meeting with social media companies, senior ministry of electronics and information technology officials emphasised the need to balance child protection with technical feasibility. An official aware of the matter, told HT on Saturday that the government is hoping for solutions through the consultation process.Technical limitations compound these challenges. A second government official familiar with the working of DigiLocker, Indian government\\u2019s DLSP, said on Saturday, that \\u201cthere is no solution yet for age verification that does not simultaneously lead to identification of the individual.\\u201dEven basic age verification through DigiLocker\\u2019s API requires including names, as multiple family members might share devices.The rules provide exemptions for certain sectors, including healthcare providers, educational institutions, and childcare centres. However, these exemptions have raised concerns about their scope and implications.\\u201cSection 9(3) ideally needs to be split into two so that DFs are not needlessly exempted from restrictions on targeted ads even as they are allowed to monitor behaviour online to assess age of the users,\\u201d multiple experts told HT. \\u201cIf a 16-year-old girl goes to a gynaecologist, she may need parental consent but how does that allow the healthcare institution to target her with ads?\\u201d asked Rana.Some experts advocated for a more nuanced and graded approach. \\u201cFor non-intrusive websites that are meant for information, why should verifiable parental consent be required,\\u201d asked Nikhil Narendran, partner at Trilegal.Aparajita Bharti, founding partner of The Quantum Hub Consulting, suggested news websites, while acting as data fiduciaries, should be exempt from parental consent requirements even if they can\\u2019t monitor children\\u2019s behaviour or target them with ads.The framework also creates unexpected data implications. Linking parent and child accounts generates new datasets about verified parents\\u2019 online behaviour. \\u201cThere is no restriction on how this data associated with the parents\\u2019 accounts can be monetised by the DFs,\\u201d Rana pointed out.Gokhale added that neither the law nor the proposed rules address problems associated with data sharing, enrichment, and cross-analysis using varied datasets.Purpose-based exemptions in the rules have sparked additional debates. Two exemptions - exercising power in a child\\u2019s interest under Indian law and blocking detrimental information - are \\u201cextremely broad,\\u201d according to Rana.\\u201cWho determines what is detrimental for a child? Is factual news about a violent incident such as a rape or a riot detrimental to the well-being of a teenager? Should children not have access to political content, conspiracy theories or misinformation? The government needs to define the classes of harm they are trying to protect children from so that in attempt to make safer internet, access to educational and historical information is not curbed.\\u201dEven seemingly straightforward exemptions raise complex questions. The rules exempt email account creation from parental consent requirements, but as Gokhale pointed out: \\u201cToday, when you sign up for an email account, you may be simultaneously signing up for allied services. How do you delink those?\\u201d For instance, signing up for Gmail signs users up for Google Maps, YouTube, and other Google services.Rana said that companies such as Google and Microsoft may have to consider delinked accounts that only offer email services for a user, who while signing up, declares that they are a minor.Bharti, however said that this exemption exists to allow schools to create email addresses for students on the school\\u2019s domain. But she asked if the exemption would allow a Google to serve ads in the Gmail account assigned by the school to the minor.The rules\\u2019 reliance on digital locker service providers (DLSPs) could also face practical hurdles. Despite the Digital Locker Authority\\u2019s existence since 2016, no digital lockers are currently listed in its directory. The limitations are visible in real-world applications: \\u201cThis is why the onus for seeking parental consent for APAAR ID has been transferred to schools, and schools are taking this consent manually, through paper consent forms. No virtual tokens are being generated to access records in DigiLocker for creating APAAR ID,\\u201d the official aware of DigiLocker\\u2019s functioning and quoted above said.The ambiguity in the rules means that experts differ on whether or not age verification is required for everybody on the internet.For Gokhale, effective verifiable consent means that age verification needs to be implemented for everyone. \\u201cAnonymity then is a thing of the past,\\u201d she said.Rana, however, says that despite the challenges, imperfect solutions might be necessary.\\u201cWhile it is true that anonymity for the child in question - by virtue of linking their account to an adult account - and that of the linked parent or guardian is gone because they have to actually prove their age and identity and it is an imperfect mechanism from the get go, it is perhaps the only mechanism that doesn\\u2019t erode privacy for everybody using digital services. The alternative where everyone has to verify their identity in some formal way before using the internet is riskier,\\u201d Rana explained.\",\n          \"Known for his no-nonsense articulation of India's position on geopolitical issues, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar had a sharp response when an Australian journalist asked him if New Delhi recognises Canberra's \\\"angst\\\" over its ties with Russia.Dr Jaishankar was speaking to Sky News Australia's Sharri Markson in an interview during his recent visit. When Ms Markson asked him if India recognises the \\\"angst\\\" its relationship with Russia causes Australia, he replied, \\\"I don't think we have given cause for any angst. In this day and age, countries don't have exclusive relationships.\\\"The minister then drew a Pakistan parallel. \\\"If I were to use that logic, I would say so many countries have relationship with Pak. Look at the angst it should cause me,\\\" he said.Dr Jaishankar then proceeded to explain how India's close ties with Russia is in the interest of the international community. Referring to Delhi's decision to buy Russian oil despite the West and other counties sanctioning Moscow after the Ukraine war broke out, the minister said,\\\"If we had not made the moves we had, the energy markets would have taken a completely different turn and precipitated a global energy crisis, it would have caused inflation across the world.\\\"He said India's ties with Russia enables it to play a role in bringing the conflict to the talks table. \\\"The fact that we have a good relationship with Russia allows us to be a country in between which has the ability to talk to both Russia and Ukraine and try to find some intersection in those conversations. i think the world, including Australia, needs such a country that will help bring this conflict back to the conference table,\\\" he said, adding, \\\"Conflicts rarely end on battlefield, mostly they end in negotiations.\\\"Australia has backed Ukraine in its conflict with Russia and supplied Kyiv with weapons. When the conflict began in 2022, then Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had said Russia should be seen as a \\\"pariah state\\\" and no country should have anything to do with them.As the West imposed sanctions on Russia, India decided to continue buying oil from Moscow. This raised eyebrows and Dr Jaishankar countered the West's questions regarding India's decision. The former diplomat had then sharply said that Europe needs to grow out of the mindset that Europe's problems are the world's problems but the world's problems are not Europe's problems. He had said India has a right to prioritise its energy needs. Later, speaking at NDTV World Summit, Dr Jaishankar had underlined that Moscow never done anything to impact India's interests negatively.On the Ukraine conflict, the Narendra Modi government has refused to take sides, with the Prime Minister stressing that this is not an era of war. The Prime Minister recently travelled to both Ukraine and Russia. India, he has said, is not neutral, but on the side of peace.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"leaning\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Left-leaning\",\n          \"Right-leaning\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":18}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.drop('source', axis=1, inplace=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"WILopId13oQy"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.sample(10)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":363},"id":"fzuO8M4-3zLQ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747596563303,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":32,"user":{"displayName":"Swarnava Banerjee","userId":"14306795758291478459"}},"outputId":"25f9a657-dd0c-4d79-882a-1b5859418636"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                  title  \\\n","1329  Chitranshul Sinha writes: SC's verdict on sedi...   \n","620   CJI's legacy of integrity: From Justice Khanna...   \n","1176  Farmers' protest: How MSP changed in UPA, NDA ...   \n","136   2024 US Election Results Highlights: Fed's Pow...   \n","54    SKM calls on pan India farmers’ protests on Ma...   \n","781   Exercise caution': India fact-checks fake news...   \n","368   BrahMos manufacturing unit set to be unveiled ...   \n","864   How long-decayed insurgent groups are growing ...   \n","80    Dilli Chalo farmers protest: Supreme Court dis...   \n","793     India’s labour market sheds post-pandemic scars   \n","\n","                                                content        leaning  \n","1329  In a batch of petitions challenging the law of...

We have taken some initiatives already... Don't think we are the only ones who are concerned with issues, there are other people also. We will not tag the petition, we are already on a larger public interest issue. This case is not about multiple petitions,\\\" a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Manmohan told the petitioner, a Punjab-based social activist.\\\"We cannot entertain repetitive petitions on the same issue.\\\"The plea had claimed that the \\\"people of Punjab and neighbouring states are facing great difficulty as they are unable to reach hospitals on time in case of medical emergency, as even ambulances are being stopped from running on national and state highways\\\".It also sought directions to the Centre and state to remove restrictions on farmers\\u2019 protests and to ensure that national highways and railway tracks were not blocked by the agitating farmers for smooth public movement.Farmers under the banner of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (non-political) and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha have been camping at the Shambhu and Khanauri border points between Punjab and Haryana since February this year after their march to Delhi was stopped by security forces.On Sunday, a delegation of 101 farmers suspended their march to the national capital from the Shambhu protest site after nine farmers were allegedly injured during clashes with law enforcement. The farm leaders will hold an internal meeting to decide the further course of action.In the wake of the farmers' renewed attempt to march towards Delhi, security has been heightened at the Punjab-Haryana border, with barricades and prohibitory orders under Section 163 (formerly Section 144) in place to prevent the gathering of more than five people.Besides Shambhu, the Khanauri border between Punjab and Haryana has also been sealed under tight four-layered security, with 13 contingents deployed.On December 6, farmers tried to move toward the national capital but suspended their bid after several protestors sustained injuries when security personnel fired tear gas shells at the border.Published By: Karishma Saurabh KalitaPublished On: Dec 9, 2024Must Watch\",\n          \"AS Justice BR Gavai assumes office as the 52nd Chief Justice of India (CJI), his swearing-in marks a historic moment: the first Buddhist and only the second Dalit to rise to this apex constitutional post. While his tenure is brief \\u2014 spanning just six months \\u2014 it carries immense symbolic and substantive expectations. He inherits not just the responsibilities of heading the judiciary but also the high bar set by his predecessor, Justice Sanjiv Khanna. Though CJI Khanna also served for just over six months, he leaves behind a rich judicial legacy marked by moral clarity, institutional humility and a refusal to blur the line between judiciary and executive.Justice Khanna\\u2019s farewell address was anything but ceremonial. His candid warning about the \\\"truth deficit\\\" in the legal profession echoed loudly in a climate where misinformation and ethical erosion are growing concerns. He urged lawyers and judges alike to adhere to \\u201ctruth and objectivity\\u201d, values he personified on and off the Bench. His refusal to accept any post-retirement role reflects his commitment to judicial independence \\u2014 an implicit critique of the revolving door between courts and governments. More tangibly, his short tenure delivered impactful verdicts that protected civil liberties, upheld constitutional values and reinforced the judiciary\\u2019s independence. These include judgments on civil rights, bail jurisprudence and institutional transparency. In an age of growing executive dominance, his restraint and clarity in adjudication offer a vital model.CJI Gavai now faces the twin challenge of maintaining institutional credibility and upholding judicial integrity. His elevation offers hope for greater representation within the judiciary. But representation must be matched with action. If he draws upon the moral compass his predecessor provided, he can make his short tenure count \\u2014 not in volume, but in vision.\",\n          \"NEW DELHI: Press Information Bureau on Wednesday fact-checked multiple social media posts from Pakistani users spreading fake news and misinformation about the Indian army in the wake of Pahalgam attack and an anticipated Indian retaliation.In a social media post on X, PIB's fact check arm flagged the \\\"false\\\" report claiming that Northern Commander Lt Gen Suchindra Kumar has been removed from his post after the Pahalgam incident.Also read: After suspending Indus Waters Treaty, India may oppose IMF\\u2019s $1.3-billion loan to Pakistan\\\"Several pro-Pakistan social media accounts falsely claim that Northern Commander Lt Gen Suchindra Kumar has been removed from his post after the Pahalgam incident,\\\" PIB said.\\u2014 PIBFactCheck (@PIBFactCheck) \\\"The claims being made in these posts are fake.

This weather haze coincided with a troubling rise in the region's Air Quality Index (AQI), which today was recorded as 'severe,' witnessing deterioration from the 'very poor' classification observed on Thursday to the 'poor' category by Wednesday. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the temperature in Delhi dropped to 9.6 degrees Celsius at 5:30 am, with forecasts predicting a low of 6 degrees Celsius and a high of around 20 degrees Celsius for the day, accompanied by \\\"very dense fog.\\\" In response to these worsening conditions, the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) has activated Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to combat pollution. Notably, these restrictions come after the recent suspension of similar measures last Sunday, which prohibited nonessential construction activities. While air quality remains a critical environmental challenge in India, with significant variations across different cities, evaluating cities across India highlights the stark contrast between them; here are the top 10 most and least polluted urban centres in India. 2025.

Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly briefing on the Gaza crisis, Permanent Representative of India to the UN, Ruchira Kamboj, also said the country is 'deeply concerned' about the conflict in Gaza. \\\"As far as India is concerned, we have been deeply troubled by the conflict in Gaza that has been raging for nearly five months now. The humanitarian crisis has deepened,\\\" Kamboj said. \\\"The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has led to a large-scale loss of civilian lives, especially women and children. This is simply unacceptable,\\\" she said. \\\"We have strongly condemned the deaths of civilians in the conflict. India has a long-standing and uncompromising position against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We demand the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.\\\"\\\"It is imperative that humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza be scaled up immediately in order to avert a further deterioration in the situation. India is committed to supporting a two-state solution where the Palestinian people are able to live freely in an independent country within secure borders with due regard to the security needs of Israel,\\\" India's Permanent Representative to the UN said. \\u00a0 \\u00a0ISRAEL-HAMAS WARIn the latest, Hamas and Egyptian mediators said on Monday they were going ahead with talks in Cairo on securing a ceasefire in Gaza, despite Israel's decision not to send a delegation, as Washington pressed again for a truce, the release of hostages and a plan to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe.The ceasefire talks, which began on Sunday, are billed as a final hurdle on the way to securing the first extended ceasefire of the five-month-old war, in time for the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which begins on Sunday.Meanwhile, in a sign of the strain between Washington and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government, US Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday hosted Benny Gantz, a longtime Netanyahu political rival who joined his war cabinet in a national unity pact at the war's start.Netanyahu has not been invited to Washington since returning to office a year ago.After Harris' meeting with Gantz, the administration said in a statement that Harris had discussed the \\\"urgency\\\" of achieving a hostage deal and \\\"expressed her deep concern about the humanitarian conditions in Gaza.\\\"Published By: Vani MehrotraPublished On: Mar 5, 2024Tune InALSO READ | UN team says rape, gang rape likely occurred during Hamas attack on IsraelALSO READ

A joint team of Military Intelligence, Indian Army Special Forces, and Diphu police gunned down two hardcore terrorists of a new outfit called the Dimasa National Liberation Army (DNLA) in the state's Karbi Anglong district. Located in central Assam, the district whose name literally translates to \\\"hills of the Karbi people\\\", shares a border with the state of Nagaland. The operation had been launched by a joint team of the district police and the Indian Army. Security forces recovered an M4 carbine, a Type 56 assault rifle and 160 live rounds of ammunition from them.A military official said the operation was planned 'with precise intelligence and coordination' and involved multiple stakeholders -- the state police, military intelligence and the Indian Army's Dimapur-based 3 Corps. Security forces had been monitoring the movements of this group over two months. Especially during the nationwide lockdown, which, a senior Assam Police official says, was being used by insurgent groups near the Bhutan-Assam-Arunachal Pradesh trijunction area to move their cadres around.Army officials say this new terrorist group -- a little over a year old -- was being trained and equipped with arms and explosives to attack Special Forces units deployed in the Northeast. The rise of an insurgent group in the Northeast would not come as a surprise. There are dozens of active militant groups in seven of the eight states which make up Northeastern India. The region is home to India's oldest insurgency -- the Naga insurgent movement -- which predates Independence.The security situation however has improved in recent years. Between 2015 and 2019, government statistics reveal, security forces have killed over 339 terrorists, arrested 5,837 and recovered 2,570 weapons. The 223 insurgency-linked deaths in 2019 are the lowest recorded in a year since 1992.On January 30 this year, various factions of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) surrendered after the government signed a Memorandum of Settlement with different Bodo groups. Lasting peace in the region is key to the Indian government's Act East Policy unveiled in 2015 that calls for promoting connectivity with ASEAN through Maynmar and Thailand.Militant groups operating there, however, have shown the ability to spring nasty surprises. On June 4, 2015 insurgents of the United Liberation Front of West South East Asia (UNLFW) ambushed an army convoy in Manipur's Chandel district killing 18 Indian Army soldiers. This led to retaliatory raids by Indian forces into camps of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang faction) inside Myanmar.Many of the insurgencies have since descended into extortion networks targeting local traders, businessmen and traders in what is euphemistically called 'taxation'. Businessmen and government employees pay up to 20 per cent of their incomes and this extortion industry was estimated at Rs 100 crore per year over a decade ago.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0- Indian official involved in peace talks\\u00a0The DNLA claimed to represent the Dimasa, the largest tribal group in the North Cachar Hills district. An influx of outsiders into tribal lands have been the source of discontent over decades and proved fertile ground for militant groups in the North East.The North Cachar Hills district, now called Dima Hasao, is one of two districts within the state to be administered by autonomous councils. Several groups have claimed to represent the Dimasa, a tribe numbering 1.4 lakh according to the 2011 census, and who live in Assam and Nagaland. An outfit called the Dimasa National Security Force (DNSF) surrendered to security forces in 1995.The latest avatar, the DNLA featured a self-styled chairman, Etiga Difusa alias Kharmindao Dimasa and Minom Phonglosa alias Gajaw Dimasa, the self-styled 'army chief'. Their group, the Dimasa Peoples Supreme Council (DPSC) used cadres from a DNSF splinter group called the Dima Halam Daogah (DHD) which laid down arms in 2013.The DNLA announced their arrival into the lucrative extortion industry of the Northeast with a grenade blast outside the home of a local resident in Karbi Anglong district during the Lok Sabha elections in April 2019. No one was killed or injured but the blast was the precursor to social media posts of armed DNLA cadres dressed in camouflage fatigues brandishing assault rifles.Army officials say the DNLA resorted to extortion and kidnappings to generate money. Their cadres roamed the Intangki reserve forest. What mystified them was the ease with which the group operated in an area controlled by the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM). The NSCN is the largest insurgent group in the North East and signed a ceasefire with the government of India in 1997. It operates out of its headquarters, Hebron Camp, in Peren district near Nagaland's capital Dimapur also the base of the 'Government of People's Republic of Nagalim'.Early clues to the DNLA's origin came on 13 August 2019 with the arrest of the group's 'training instructor' John Dimasa alias Master. Arrested in a joint army and Assam Police operation near Kherbari area in Assam, John revealed what security forces had long suspected -- the DNLA was an NSCN(IM) proxy. The NSCN had raised, trained, armed and sheltered their cadres but did not do it for free. The Dimasas had to buy their weapons -- Rs 1.5 lakh per AK-47 type rifle and between Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh for a US-made M16M4 rifle.\\\"The NSCN (I-M) wanted to expand their extortion network in the Ingtangki reserve forest and Dimasa hills,\\\" an army official explains. They were eyeing a cut from the illegal timber and beetle nut smuggling from Ingtangki reserve forest and Dima Hasao district. Using smaller groups to do this was clearly not a new stratagem.A 2016 research paper by Brigadier Sushil Sharma for the Vivekananda International Foundation credits the NSCN for 'finding a novel way of generating revenue from smaller underground surrogates'. The NSCN has in the past used groups like the DHD in Assam, Hmar People's Convetion in Mizoram, Kanglie Yawol Kamba Lup (KYKL) and Kuki Revoutionary Army (KRA) in Manipurf for extortion. Each group claimed to represent a different tribal ethnicity in different states but operated under the NSCN which could thus spread their tentacles across the entire North East.A second operation on January 28 this year, dealt another blow to the DNLA and revealed more information about the proxy group's structure and connect with the NSCN (IM). The DNLA 'military chief' Minom Phonglosa was captured by a joint operation of Military Intelligence, Assam Rifles and Diphu police. DNLA cadres, Phonglosa revealed, had actually been trained in the Hebron camp.\\u00a0Ninong Phonglosa, DNLA military chief captured by security forces on January 28 this year.\\u00a0A video in police custody shows Phonglosa talking about meeting a self styled Brigadier Chiphemi Shimrang of NSCN(IM) near the Hebron Camp in January this year. The 'Brigadier' asked Phonglosa to target security forces by using RDX, TNT and other high grade explosives. Army sources believe there are factions within the Nagas.The DNLA is being supported by an NSCN faction including Phungting Shimrang, the former commander-in-chief of the Naga army and 'Brigadier' Shimrang. Both renegade NSCN leaders are believed to have escaped into Mynamar. 'The renegade Shimrangs want the DNLA to carry out attacks on the Indian Army for which RDX and timers are being offered,' an army officials said.An official involved in peace talks calls the NSCN (IM) 'the most dangerous Indian insurgent group' in the country. \\\"They are in bed with practically every insurgent group in the Northeast, they have birthed groups like the ULFA and NDFB, they are involved across several states like Arunachal Pradesh and Assam -- that's what makes them so dangerous.\\\" The group has in the past had links with both the Pakistan's ISI and China's MSS. It has deep networks within the arms smuggling networks of Southeast Asia and demonstrated the ability to move massive weapons consignments into the Northeast.Attempts to defeat them militarily have failed for over four decades. This is the reason the official believes the government must integrate them into the mainstream. This has yet to happen. On August 3, 2015 the government of India signed a framework agreement with the NSCN (IM) raising hopes of a negotiated settlement. On October 31, 2019, the two sides signed another agreement, short of a final deal. The final agreement has been held up pending major disagreements over a few issues. The NSCN (I-M) wants a separate flag, a constitution and a 'Greater Nagalim' which will include Nagas living in other states of the North-East. The government of India is loath to accede to this. The key to a lasting peace in the region would clearly be resolving this deadlock.\\u00a0READ | Northeast votes and the CAA\\u00a0\\u00a0READ | J&K: A return to the old normal?\\u00a0\\u00a0WATCH | Can govt contain Citizenship Amendment Bill fire in Northeast?\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Published By: Dev GoswamiPublished On: May 5, 2020--- ENDS ---\",\n          \"Written By Anwesha Sen On January 31, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) notified the Aadhaar Authentication for Good Governance (Social Welfare, Innovation, Knowledge) Amendment Rules, 2025, an amendment to the 2020 rules. This change permits private entities to use Aadhaar authentication for service delivery, a move that MeitY claims will ease access to services for users. However, while the intention behind this amendment may seem to be to streamline service delivery, it opens the door to more concerning issues \\u2014 threats to privacy and inclusion. Due to the lack of clarity and transparency around the system and its processes, the extent to which this move may impact surveillance and privacy is unclear. The Aadhaar and Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) ecosystem in India has already faced significant challenges, particularly in terms of data security and privacy. Some of the largest data breaches in India\\u2019s history have involved Aadhaar-related data, including the 2023 breach of the CoWIN portal and the ICMR database, the latter of which exposed personally identifiable information of at least 815 million Indians. The centralisation of this data \\u2014 linking a single Aadhaar number to each individual \\u2014 makes the system especially vulnerable to cyber-attacks. With this latest amendment, the potential for such breaches grows exponentially as the scope of Aadhaar\\u2019s usage expands, leaving even more sensitive data susceptible to misuse. Aadhaar was initially intended as a voluntary identity verification system. However, in practice, it is increasingly becoming a requirement for accessing public services. By 2021, access to 312 government schemes had been made conditional on possessing a biometric-linked Aadhaar number. With this amendment, Aadhaar is set to become equally essential for accessing private services, making it functionally mandatory. This contradicts the Supreme Court's 2018 ruling, which declared that Aadhaar should remain voluntary. Furthermore, the same ruling struck down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act, which had allowed private entities to use Aadhaar for identity verification, primarily to prevent commercial profiteering from demographic and biometric information, as well as profiling. This amendment, therefore, not only undermines the Court\\u2019s decision but also brings us closer to a system where Aadhaar is no longer voluntary but instead de facto compulsory for accessing both public and private services. Aadhaar is based on an exclusionary principle \\u2014 its primary goal was to curb welfare fraud. However, this has resulted in the exclusion of many marginalised groups from accessing public services. In a 2021 survey in Delhi, 40 per cent of individuals faced exclusion due to authentication errors. This problem is especially severe for people who, due to their circumstances, have never been able to obtain an official identity card. Migrant labourers and construction workers, for instance, often lack the required address proof, making it nearly impossible for them to apply for an Aadhaar card. As more services, both public and private, become contingent on Aadhaar, these vulnerable groups face even greater barriers to receiving the support they need. Furthermore, this exclusionary aspect of Aadhaar extends beyond just service access. By tying essential services like healthcare, education, and social welfare to a single identification system, the government and private sector are further expanding the existing digital divide that disproportionately impacts those who are already marginalised. For these individuals, Aadhaar is not a tool for inclusion but a barrier to participation in society and access to their state-assured rights. The expansion of Aadhaar\\u2019s use raises significant concerns for privacy and inclusion. As the system moves from a voluntary identity verification method to an essential requirement for accessing both public and private services, the risk of widespread surveillance becomes more pronounced. Considering the opacity around this system and its processes, the extent of these risks is unknown. If data is collected, linked, and stored in Aadhaar\\u2019s database, it can be used to track individuals in ways that threaten personal privacy. Given the massive data breaches and security flaws already present in the system, there is no guarantee that sensitive information, if collected, will be safe. The government must take a step back and consider the broader implications of expanding Aadhaar\\u2019s use. Moreover, policymakers need to ensure that the use of Aadhaar does not go beyond its intended purpose, respecting the Supreme Court's 2018 ruling and preventing the erosion of individuals' rights to privacy and dignity. This amendment implicitly leads to Aadhaar becoming the foundational identification for Indians and such a step should necessarily involve more transparency about the system and its processes, as well as a public consultation, not just a gazette notification.\",\n          \"Most economists agree that a lack of good-quality jobs, particularly for India\\u2019s burgeoning young population, is one of the urgent priorities to address. It is also generally perceived that in the recent elections, joblessness was a critical issue. Election results in some states show that welfarism is not enough to placate large sections of the electorate. Although the pre-election Congress manifesto had shown a bit more sensitivity to the job issue than that of other parties and came up with some concrete suggestions (though not fully worked out), it is well-known that joblessness has been a persistent problem over many decades and across all regimes. Those who think growth will automatically solve the job problem overlook that 50 years of national surveys on employment and unemployment have made it clear that India\\u2019s job availability has not, in general, kept pace with the rate of economic growth. If left unattended, this is a socially explosive problem. It is high time that all political parties, both at the Centre and the states, give concentrated attention to details of design, cost-effectiveness and implementation issues for different types of job-promoting policies. I shall give some examples of possible policies and draw attention to the experience available in India and other developing countries. Of course, we now have some accumulated experience of running rural employment guarantee schemes introduced at the central level in 2005. These schemes are for manual, often back-breaking, work, under a scorching sun for the very poor. But even here, parts of the original law remain as yet largely unimplemented \\u2014 such as the worker rarely receiving unemployment benefits if the job is not provided within 15 days, or the inordinate delays in wage payments; in most cases, work has been provided on average for much less than the stipulated 100 days per household, and so on. There has been talk of having such a central programme of employment guarantee in the urban sector (beyond scattered attempts in some states). This requires serious consideration \\u2014 there has been some discussion around a proposal on this by Jean Dreze titled \\u201cDecentralised Urban Employment and Training\\u201d (DUET) scheme. One may particularly think of ways of putting people to work on improving urban infrastructure, water and other environmental resources. It\\u2019ll be, of course, costly; estimates for giving jobs to 20 million urban casual workers easily run to above Rs 1 trillion. (But to get an idea of comparative magnitude, in September 2019, the Ministry of Finance, in a single stroke, substantially reduced the corporate tax rate that amounted to a revenue loss of Rs 1.84 trillion over the next two years). But such rural and urban employment guarantee schemes are mainly concerned with relief or \\u201cdistress\\u201d employment, however necessary, for the poor. We actually need, on a long-term basis, an array of sustainable programmes of reasonably good jobs which go beyond short-run relief. Let me suggest four such areas which may have a lot of potential. A part of our unemployment problem is really a problem of employability at the current level of low skills and training. A mass-scale vocational educational programme with links to apprenticeship in business firms needs to be started on a war footing to make up for decades of negligence. There are a great deal of successful cases to learn from: The German case, where potential employers contribute to vocational programmes into which school-leavers stream, saving worker-screening costs for those employers, or the California community college-cum-vocational system working in partnership with local firms. Even in developing countries, there are now relatively successful cases like the Kenya Youth Employment and Opportunities Project, Generation India programme, Youth Building the Future Programme in Colombia, the Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator projects in several African countries, etc. Coordination between firms, local governments, business associations and civic organisations are essential in most cases. In India, there is a plethora of capital subsidies in different sectors in the name of encouraging investment. They distort investment in a labour-replacing capital-intensive direction. We should take stock of these capital subsidies and replace many of them with wage subsidies, particularly for large firms in the organised sectors on the condition that they create new regular jobs. We are familiar with agricultural extension services, but now we should pay equal attention to technical assistance and extension services (including management training) to non-farm household enterprises to help them in productive job-creating directions. There have been similar cases of helping community health and caregiving workers (like the case of software aid to ASHA workers in some districts of UP). Finally, much of the usual discussion on job promotion seriously ignores the demand deficiency problem that our private investors face in the mass consumer market. This problem has been accentuated by our large income and wealth inequality, where the benefits of growth are concentrated at the top and people at the bottom suffer from stagnant wages and employment. Raising incomes of these latter sections will boost demand and thus create more jobs on a large scale, and one relatively efficient way to do it is to give all such groups (not just the farmers) a basic income supplement. A minimum income also gives a poor worker trapped in a \\u201cbad\\u201d job the means to seek better jobs. Where will the money come from? A modest basic income supplement can be funded by drastically reducing the direct and indirect subsidies that the government currently gives to the better-off. This can be supplemented by more taxation of the rich. In India, a land of hereditary plutocracy, where data shows that wealth inequality is galloping, inheritance and wealth taxes are zero and the capital gains tax rate is much lower than in the US. Of course, action here will require political courage and imagination.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

Our MP had promised that government would grant 6th schedule to Ladakh,\\u201d he said.Thupstan pointed out that a memorandum was submitted and a panel was formed to meet the Prime Minister when government suddenly went back on its words.\\u201cAfter so many rounds of talks, the Centre is still not able to finalise anything. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going to happen tomorrow at the meeting,\\u201d he said.He lamented that three rounds of discussions with the Union home minister remained inconclusive.\\u201cCentre says 6th schedule is confined to two to three northeastern states and if they grant it to Ladakh, then it may open a pandora\\u2019s box as other states with tribal population may start demanding it,\\u201d he said.He said that amid talks, the LAB and KDA have also confined to four demands, viz statehood, legislative assembly, safeguards under 6th schedule and formation of a public service commission.\\u201cIn recent meetings, we gave up our demand of two Parliamentary constituencies because there is a rider on delimitation till 2026. Some compromise has to be done to reach a solution,\\u201d he said.He added that if the talks fail, then the people would be compelled to intensify their agitation. \\u201cHowever, a decision on fast unto death by renowned environmentalist Sonam Wangchuk and other leaders will be taken after the outcome of the meeting,\\u201d the leader said.He expressed hope that the Centre takes a call before model code of conduct is put in place for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls because to meet the demands, constitutional amendments are required.Wangchuk said, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t want to go on fast unto death, but if compelled, then we have to. In 2019, when Ladakh was made a Union Territory, the government promised 6th schedule in its manifesto and in various minutes of the meetings\\u201d.\\u201cThereafter, it turned silent and is now opposing it. There are certain industrial and mining lobbies which don\\u2019t want Ladakh to be safeguarded under the 6th schedule,\\u201d said Wangchuk.We think it becomes indispensable for us to raise our voice because if we remain silent, these lobbies will prevail. We hope things come out well in the meeting and we are not compelled to go on fast unto death, he addedWangchuk said that this being a movement by the people of Ladakh, hundreds would go on fast for 10 days.\",\n          \"In a significant boost to India\\u2019s space ambitions, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a substantial allocation of Rs 13,415.20 crore for the Department of Space in the Union Budget 2025-26, a remarkable increase from the previous year's allocation of Rs 13,042.75 crore. The budget earmarks Rs 6,103 crore specifically for capital outlay on space research, which is expected to facilitate various ambitious projects, including satellite launches and deep-space missions. The enhanced budget reflects India's growing focus on leveraging space technology for national development and governance.The increased investment aims to integrate space-based applications into critical sectors such as agriculture, disaster management, and urban planning. \\\"The Union Budget 2025 strengthens India's position as a technology and innovation hub with key measures that support deep tech, space, and advanced manufacturing.  The National Geospatial Mission and National Manufacturing Mission will bolster high-tech domestic production and reinforce India\\u2019s global leadership. This is arguably one of the most impactful developments for the private space industry since the space policy,\\\" Awais Ahmed, Founder and CEO of Pixxel said. Isro, which is known for conducting cost-effective missions globally, will be happy about the boost in its allocations as it plans to build bigger and long-lasting missions, while fostering international collaboration.Centre has allocated Rs 10,230.20 crore to various Isro centers and projects, including Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), U R Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), and Human Space Flight Centre (HSFC). Space Applications Centre of Isro has received the second-largest share at Rs 1,706.8 crore in the 2025-26 budget.The budget also emphasizes the importance of public-private partnerships in the space sector. With the government's liberalized Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy, which allows up to 100% FDI in satellite manufacturing and related systems, it aims to foster innovation and attract private sector participation. This is expected to create a conducive environment for startups and established companies alike to thrive in the burgeoning space economy.It is worth mentioning that the Cabinet had recently approved several big-ticket missions that include Chandrayaan-4, Venus Orbiter Mission, development of the Next Generation Launch vehicle, and construction of a new spaceport along with a third launch pad at the Staish Dhawan Space Centre. Industry experts have welcomed this budgetary boost as a pivotal moment for India's space sector, positioning it as a global player in space exploration and technology.

The rise in textile manufacturing costs also contributed to the increase, according to the latest data.\\u201cThe annual rate of inflation based on all India WPI is 2.37% (provisional) for December 2024, compared to December 2023,\\u201d the Ministry of Commerce and Industry stated on Tuesday.\\u201cThe positive rate of inflation in December 2024 is primarily due to price increases in food articles, manufacture of food products, other manufacturing, manufacture of textiles, and non-food articles,\\u201d the ministry added.In November 2024, India\\u2019s wholesale prices increased by 1.89% year-on-year, easing from a 2.36% gain in October. Driven by surging food prices, particularly vegetables, October recorded a four-month high of 2.36%. Although fuel and power costs declined, food inflation soared, significantly impacting potato and onion prices.Inflation Food IndexWPI Food Index saw a marginal decrease to 8.89% in December 2024 from 8.92% in November 2024, as per the ministry.Comprising \\u2018food articles\\u2019 from primary articles group and \\u2018food products\\u2019 from manufactured products group, the food index decreased from 200.3 in November 2024, to 195.9 in December 2024.A reduction was recorded in food items like cereals, pulses, wheat.\\u00a0However, inflation in vegetables was recorded at 28.65% against 28.57% in November. Potatoes continued to rule high at 93.20% and onions at 16.81% in December. Meat, fish and eggs also increased to 5.43% in December from 3.16% in November.In manufactured items, inflation was 2.14%, against 2% in November.The fuel and power category witnessed a deflation of 3.79% in December against a deflation of 5.83% in November.Meanwhile, the recent retail inflation data showed that Consumer Price Index (CPI) eased marginally to a 4-month low of 5.22% in December from 5.48% in November.Understanding WPI, CPI, PPIFor recording inflation, two indices \\u2014WPI and CPI \\u2014 are tracked.\\u00a0There is another factor, Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures the average change in prices received by producers for goods and services.WPI and CPI reflect prices at the wholesale and retail levels, respectively, and PPI at the production stage, what producers get for their output.WPI tracks prices at the wholesale level before the goods reach consumers while CPI is about the average price at the level of consumers.Policy makers largely rely on WPI and CPI \\u2014 the long-established indices with historical data for comparison.There is demand for comprehensive PPI data, which experts say is \\u201cmore robust tracker of changes in wholesale prices\\u201d.It is all interlinkedThe fact is if producers experience higher input costs, they are bound to pass it on to wholesalers, causing WPI to rise.\\u00a0If wholesale prices rise, retailers will also increase prices for consumers, leading to a\\u00a0higher CPI.Most developed countries track\\u00a0PPI and\\u00a0reports quoting officials suggest that India too is getting ready to shift and

10.EAM Jaishankar also reiterated that India was only willing to talk to Pakistan regarding its plans to dismantle terrorism and that until then the Indus Waters Treaty would remain in abeyance.Defence minister Rajnath Singh, director general of the BSF Daljit Singh Chaudhary and Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi visited the Badami Bagh Cantonment in Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday as well.The defence minister said that UN\\'s International Atomic Energy Agency should take charge of Pakistan\\'s nuclear weapons.Coming down heavily on Pakistan, Rajnath Singh asked the world whether nuclear weapons are safe in the hands of “such an irresponsible and rogue nation”.The defence minister also hailed the armed forces of the nation and saluted the valour of those injured in the line of duty during the cross-border fighting following Operation Sindoor.Operation Sindoor: How India thrashed Pak\\'s air defenceThe ministry of defence, in an official press release on Wednesday, detailed Operation Sindoor and said that Indian Air Force bypassed and jammed Pakistan\\'s Chinese-supplied air defence systems and completed the mission in just 23 minutes. India affirmed that the armed forces struck terrorist infrastructure and eliminated multiple threats without crossing the Line of Control (LoC) or the international boundary.The official release also highlighted that Operation Sindoor represented a significant milestone in India\\'s journey towards technological self-reliance in military operations.The operation produced concrete evidence of neutralized hostile technologies, including pieces of PL-15 missiles (of Chinese origin), Turkish-origin UAVs named \"Yiha\" or \"YEEHAW\", long-range rockets, quadcopters and commercial drones.India briefs UNSCIndian officials briefed the UN Security Council\\'s 1267 Sanctions Committee on the activities of The Resistance Front (TRF), the group behind the Pahalgam terror attack, HT reported.The Indian technical team, visiting New York to interact with the committee\\'s monitoring team, will also meet representatives of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) and Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED).Operation KellerAn official said that terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) suffered a major loss with three of its members, including \\'Operations Commander\\' Shahid Kuttay, being killed in an encounter in the south Kashmir\\'s Shopian, a report from news agency PTI stated.Kuttay along with Adnan Shafi, a resident of Vanduna Melhura, and Ahsan ul Haq Sheikh, a resident of Pulwama\\'s Murran, were gunned down on Tuesday in an encounter in Shukroo Keller area.The Indian Army said that Operation Keller was launched by the security forces on the basis of intelligence inputs about the terrorists\\' presence in the area.Other than the neutralization of the terrorists, the armed forces also recovered huge cache of arms and ammunition from their possession, including two AK series rifle, grenades and other war-like stores.India Pakistan ceasefire | Top pointsThe Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) suspended a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Turkey\\'s Inonu University after the country showed support to Pakistan amid rising tensions with India.

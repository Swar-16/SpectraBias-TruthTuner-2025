This time demands clarity, integrity, and dharma-driven creativity with the Solar and Lunar New Year changes, Saturn's entrance into Pisces, and a unique six-planet stellium sparking Vishvavasu Samvatsara (Sun-ruled). Founders in this new age have to match natural and cosmic rhythms, creating not only goods but also deliberate, soul-centered movements meant to endure.The coming decade is a karmic reset, not only a linear progression of the startup environment. The corporate world is entering an age where disturbance has to meet dharma given unusual and strong astrological transits on the horizon, including Saturn in Pisces, Pluto in Aquarius, and Jupiter's fast movement across zodiac signs. Founders, investors, and creative people are called to lead with intention, awareness, and cosmic alignment during this period. 2025\\u201326: Realignment, Conscious Growth, and Regional Disruption Marking a strong energy turn, the year begins with a rare six-planet stellium in Pisces. Saturn starts its passage through Pisces and Jupiter travels between Taurus and Gemini, hence triggering a change from material grounding to cerebral mobility. Ruled by the Sun, the Vishvavasu Samvatsara marks the year when the soul of a startup will be as important as its size. Sectors Poised for GrowthSpiritual Tech and WellnessPlatforms combining Vedic sciences with artificial intelligence, augmented reality/virtual reality, and immersive technology will attract both domestic and foreign interest. Look for a rise in virtual temple experiences, digital yoga environments, and mantra-based meditation app. CleanTech and Eco-InnovationStartups concentrating on water security, circular economy logistics, renewable energy, and electric transportation will become more relevant and valuable. AgriTech and Rural EmpowermentModels such as agri-fintech, farm-to-fork logistics, and rural digitization will experience unmatched scale under Jupiter's encouraging impact. SpaceTech and AerospaceIndia's growing space capacity will help aerospace and defense-aligned companies, several of which will attain unicorn status. Mental Health and Conscious LivingDigital therapy, Indic psychology, longevity, clean and nutritious diet and spiritual productivity apps will becoming popular. SkillTech and Ethical EdTechYounger audiences will be drawn to AR/VR-enabled platforms for Sanskrit, dharmic education, and value-based learning under SkillTech and Ethical EdTech. Sectors Facing Erosion/RestructuringSpeculative Fintech and CryptoEspecially for immoral or non-compliant strategies, regulatory crackdowns are probable in speculative fintech and cryptocurrency. Luxury Lifestyle StartupsVentures based on shallow value propositions can struggle under Ketu's indifference to beauty. Influencer-heavy commerceBusinesses motivated by vanity statistics or trend gimmicks lacking substance may lose relevance. Over-Leveraged EdTechCompanies concentrating on rapid expansion without sustainable results or student confidence may suffer severe corrections. Funding and Investment TrendsThe new investment filter will be ethical, dharmic, and sustainable governance EDSG replacing conventional ESG frameworks. Funding will slow but stay strategic and impact-driven after May 2025. Government-backed awards will assist rural innovation, climate technology, organic agricultural, and Ayurveda enterprises. Ideas in line with Bharat's core economy and culture will be funded by a new wave of angel investors from Tier 2+ cities. M&A and Strategic Consolidation:Digital-native and spiritually oriented firms will be acquired by established beauty, health, and fashion giants. Especially in conscious commerce and wellness, rival companies might combine to offset market weariness. Larger defense and healthcare companies will actively buy quantum technology, AR, and AI businesses. Other Emerging ThemesStartups facilitating dharmic lifestyle alignment, spiritual journaling, and karma tracking. Especially in consumer-facing companies, founders will be required to reflect inner clarity and public integrity. Startups in coastal or climate-sensitive areas will require robust infrastructure and risk management plans. Indian knowledge system experts Jyotish, Ayurveda, temple culture, and Sanskrit education will find worldwide markets. Platforms providing dharmic workplace planning and astrology-based team dynamics will join the aware corporate arena. Legal Tech tools for handling spiritual donations, temple trusts, and compliance will experience steady but quiet increase. Key Disruptions and RealignmentsStartups not meeting ethical, legal, or financial transparency criteria could close or be penalized. Public opinion will be very important; cultural value mismatch can cause negative reaction. Conflicts among cofounders, ego battles, and karmic misalignments will challenge the leadership of startups. Profitability and purpose-first models will propel Tier 2 and Tier 3 city startups. Models of cooperative, distribution-first commerce will surpass those of ad-heavy, D2C-first strategies. Planet-Driven Outlook: 2025\\u201320352025\\u20132027: Spiritual Realignment and DisruptionSaturn in Pisces and Pluto in Aquarius herald a time of karmic testing and systematic creativity. Startups based in genuine narrative, spiritual technology, sustainability, and wellness will flourish. Ideas without substance will suffer severe correction. Regional languages and culture-aligned media-tech communication-first platforms will scale quickly. 2027\\u20132029: Visionary Expansion and Youth DisruptionYouth-led, daring businesses in immersive learning, Dharma-centered material, and AI-integrated Indic knowledge will arise with Saturn in Aries and Uranus in Gemini. Jupiter's passage through Leo and Virgo will promote narrative and accuracy. Target execution-first entrepreneurs, not early-stage capital flows. Creator-led platforms, policy-tech, and EdTech rule. 2029\\u20132031: Value Consolidation and Ethical RebuildingEmphasis changes to profound value, conformity, and regenerative money when Saturn passes into Taurus and Jupiter enters Libra and Scorpio. Legal platforms, climate tech, cybersecurity, and rural-first brands prosper. IP based in Bharat becomes globally important; EDSG sets the new norm for scalability. 2031\\u20132033: Conscious Scaling and Global DharmaJupiter's entry into Sagittarius signals worldwide growth for Indian Knowledge Systems. Astrology-based HR solutions, spiritual tourism platforms, and TempleTech become popular. Large valuations are attracted by startups concentrating on land, water, food, and sustainability. IPOs with dharmic stories stand out as a fresh category. Karma Is the New CapitalThe next ten years will belong not to the noisiest startups but to the most in line. Startups that design for dharma, have integrity, and aim beyond profit will create not simply values but legacies. This is not the time for progress fueled by drama. Inner alignment, strategic clarity, and karmic responsibility define this age.

Since then they have been systematically disempowered, deprived and stifled our voices,\\u201d he added.\",\n          \"The five Supreme Court judges who gave the verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case in 2019 have been invited to the consecration ceremony of Ram Lalla in the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple in Ayodhya on January 22, reported Law Today.The invitation has also been extended to over 50 jurists including former Chief Justices, judges and prominent lawyers.The five-judge bench, comprising then-CJI Ranjan Gogoi, former CJI SA Bobde, current CJI DY Chandrachud and former judges Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer, had ruled in favour of the construction of a grand Ram temple by a trust at the disputed site on November 9, 2019.The bench granted the entire disputed land to the deity Ram Lalla and ordered the government to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Muslim side to build a mosque. In Ayodhya, the Babri mosque stood atop the site of the birthplace of Lord Ram, an opinion that the saffron camp began building into a sustained campaign starting in the late 1980s, eventually leading to the mosque\\u2019s demolition in 1992.Currently, ex-CJI Gogoi is serving as a Rajya Sabha MP, nominated by the President. Justice Bobde succeeded Justice Gogoi as the 47th Chief Justice of India from November 18, 2019, to April 23, 2021. Justice Chandrachud is currently serving as the Chief Justice of India. Justice Ashok Bhushan retired as a judge of the Supreme Court in July 2021, and Justice Nazeer is serving as Governor of Andhra Pradesh.Meanwhile, invitation cards for the consecration ceremony have been sent out to over 7,000 guests, including 3,000 VVIPs, priests, donors and several politicians.The week-long vedic rituals for the pran-pratishtha ceremony of Ram Lalla entered their fourth day on Friday with the lighting of the holy fire followed by the establishment of 'Navagraha' and a 'Havan'.The 51-inch idol of Ram Lalla, carved by sculptor Arun Yogiraj, was placed inside the temple's sanctum sanctorum on Thursday.

The worshippers of Lord Ram have been given land for the construction of a temple at the very site where the Babri Masjid stood between 1528 and December 6, 1992. The Nirmohi Akhara has welcomed the judgment as it will be given some representation in the trust that would construct the temple. The Sunni Waqf Board too must have the satisfaction that the highest court has accepted their central argument that the Babri Masjid was a Sunni, and not Shia, waqf property, and the same was not constructed after demolishing the Ram temple. Thus, the court has rejected the Hindu right’s narrative on the Babri mosque. This false narrative not only was responsible for galvanising the ordinary Hindus, but also gave some sort of legitimacy to divisive electoral politics. Similarly, Muslim grievances about the trespass in 1949 and the tragic demolition of the mosque in 1992 have been accepted by the court. In fact, the court has accepted that there was an injury caused to them — i.e. violation of their legal right. Accordingly, the court, invoking its extraordinary jurisdiction of doing complete justice, has given them almost double the land in Ayodhya. The Ayodhya dispute did not begin in 1528 with Babur, the founder of Mughal empire, but in 1886 with litigation in the British courts over a chabutra (courtyard) that was constructed outside the Babri Masjid by one Mahant Raghubar Das in the late 1850s. When the British prevented the construction of a canopy over the chabutra, Das unsuccessfully litigated his cause in three judicial forums. Each time, the courts emphasised status quo — that is, the Muslims would pray inside the Babri Masjid while the Hindus had limited rights to pray at the chabutra. Surprisingly, the apex court has rejected title of Muslims for want of proof of title document. This may have repercussions for several temples and mosques. The court rejected the revenue record and gazetteers as sufficient proof. Even the British grant papers were said to be sufficient only for proving the upkeep of the mosque. In law, the phrase “status quo” means the situation at the time of the judgment must not be changed. The Babri litigation is a story of changing “status quo”. On the night of December 22-23, 1949, trespassers placed Lord Ram’s idol under the central dome of the Babri Masjid. In a few days after the incident, a new status quo would be sanctified by the local courts: Muslims were not allowed to pray inside the mosque, the idol would not be removed, and that Hindus would have a “limited” right to pray and pujaris would ensure daily bhog. By one act of criminal trespass, a mosque was converted into a temple. On February 1, 1986, District Judge K M Pandey would order the unlocking of gates that acted as a “barrier” between the idols inside the masjid and the devotees who had come for the darshan. This decision had the blessing of then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who in order to mollify the self-anointed regressive Muslim leadership would subsequently introduce the bill to reverse the Shah Bano judgment on February 25, 1986. The demolition of the mosque on December 6, 1992 was also the destruction of the rule of law. The SC has rightly criticised it and accepted that it was in violation of the “status quo” order passed by it. Within a few hours of the mosque’s demolition, a makeshift temple had come up at the structure’s location. Within a month of the demolition, the Allahabad High Court allowed for darshan at the makeshift temple. In 1994, the Supreme Court, while dealing with the Acquisition of Certain Areas of Ayodhya Act, ordered the protection of the latest “status quo”: No mosque but a makeshift temple and legally protected darshan at the site. In 2010, the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court ruled that the title suit must be decided as a question of joint-ownership of property. Muslims, the deity Ram Lalla and Nirmohi Akhara were to get one-third share of the disputed property. The Supreme Court has overruled this judgment and rightly held that it was not a partition suit. The judgment will be remembered for the victory of faith over the rule of law as the Supreme Court considered religious beliefs even in deciding a property dispute, and despite conceding that faith cannot confer title, it still went ahead to give property to worshippers on the basis of faith. The court should not have any say in matters of freedom of religion, but deciding title suit on the basis of faith is a thorny proposition. In brief, it is the red letter day for the constitutional right to religion but a setback to property law and a setback to evidence law with differential burden of proof being demanded from different parties.

Several speeches of Gandhi of late have had a reference to Murmu. The Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha has accused the BJP and the RSS of being anti-Dalit and anti-tribal as the Narendra Modi government kept the President and her predecessor Ram Nath Kovind out of the foundation stone laying and inauguration of the new Parliament building and the consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. For instance, addressing the “Jai Bapu, Jai Bhim, Jai Samvidhan” rally in Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, on Monday, Gandhi said, “The BJP says that a second independence has been achieved, that true independence has been achieved. I want to ask you, did you see any poor person at the inauguration of the Ram Temple? Did you see any labourer, any farmer, any backward community member? We have a President who is Adivasi, but the President was not allowed inside the temple. Dalits were not allowed inside, backward communities were not allowed inside. The inauguration of Parliament happened, but the President was not allowed inside. Narendra Modi says you are tribals, but you cannot come inside. This is the reality.” The most prominent theme of Gandhi’s speeches since the Lok Sabha election campaign has been the accusation that Prime Minister Modi and the BJP government were denigrating the Constitution. Displaying a pocket-sized Constitution with a red cover since then, he argued that the BJP had little respect for the Constitution and wanted to change it. During the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, addressing a group of tribals in Gujarat’s Dahod district in March 2024, he brought up the matter of Murmu’s absence from the Ram Temple inauguration. “You all saw the Ram Mandir inauguration, but did you see the President of India there? Why was she not allowed to enter? It was because she was a tribal so she was prohibited … Did you see any poor farmers or labourers? But you saw RSS leaders inside the temple and you saw in attendance the Adanis, Ambanis, and the whole of Bollywood and cricket fraternity. Did you see any poor person?” The Ram Temple Trust subsequently dismissed Gandhi’s allegations and claimed the President had been invited to the consecration event on January 22, 2024. And not just Gandhi, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge too has often accused the BJP government of “humiliating” President Murmu and her predecessor Kovind by not inviting them to the three events. The BJP's strident attack following Sonia Gandhi’s remarks aims to disrupt and damage the carefully crafted social justice narrative of the Congress. Gandhi and the Congress have been talking the language of social justice for some time now, from goals such as the equal representation of castes and a nationwide caste census to the removal of the 50 per cent ceiling on reservation. It is no surprise that the BJP, especially Prime Minister Modi, latched on to the remarks to argue that the Congress insults the poor, OBCs, Dalits, and tribals at every step. After all, the Winter Session of Parliament ended with the Congress and the Opposition up in arms against Union Home Minister Amit Shah over his remarks about B R Ambedkar. Replying to a debate in Rajya Sabha on the “Glorious Journey of 75 Years of the Constitution of India”, Shah said last month: “Abhi ek fashion ho gaya hai - Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar. Itna naam agar Bhagwan ka lete toh saat janmon tak swarg mil jata (There is a fashion these days — Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar, Ambedkar … Had you chanted the name of God these many times, you would have been blessed with heaven in seven births).” He went on to add “we are happy that Ambedkar’s name is being taken” before listing the Congress’s “injustices” towards him. Now it is payback time for the BJP. The Congress has no option but to defend Sonia and Rahul but many leaders in private feel the remarks were too casual. Some feel it was all about optics too. All three members of the Gandhi family found themselves in a rare frame and talking about the President's address in a rather casual manner. While Rahul Gandhi called the President’s address “boring”, Sonia said, “Poor lady, the President was getting very tired by the end. She could hardly speak, poor thing.” After making those remarks about the President, Rahul Gandhi, in his white T-shirt, and Priyanka engaged in a playful conversation in full media glare. ”Nice saree Priyanka,” the Leader of Opposition told his sister who replied it was their grandmother’s and that all of her nice sarees were from her mother and grandmother.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.loc[554, 'content']"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":348},"id":"JU8sAx8TK4Yk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747568093446,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":58,"user":{"displayName":"Swarnava Banerjee","userId":"14306795758291478459"}},"outputId":"c1a9974f-4742-40dd-db6c-3d43f2ea0feb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'With Sanmyukta Kisan Morcha (non-political) leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal&#039;s fast unto death entering the 43rd day, farmers have announced a nationwide tractor march on January 26 in protest against the Central government.Among a host of other announcements on Tuesday, farmers said that hundreds of tractors will hit the streets and roads as a mark of protest against the Centre on the day. Since February 13, 2024, farmers, under the umbrella of SKM (non-political) and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha, have been protesting at the Punjab-Haryana border in Khanauri with a demand that the Centre give legal guarantee on Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their crops.Besides the MSP guarantee, farmers are demanding a debt waiver, pension, no hike in electricity tariffs, withdrawal of police cases, and justice for the victims of the 2021 Lakhimpur Kheri violence. The farmers have been camping at the Khanauri border after security forces stopped their march to Delhi.Before the tractor march on Republic Day, the farmers also plan to burn the drafts of the new farming policy in villages on January 13.JAGJIT SINGH DALLEWAL HEALTH UPDATEThe condition of farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal, who has been on an indefinite strike since November 26, remains critical as his health deteriorated and his blood pressure dropped, a doctor who conducted his check-up said.&quot;Last night, we thought that Jagjit Dalewal had left us. We cannot even give him medicine due to his fast. He vomited last evening and after that his BP went down. Jagjit Dalewal&#039;s condition last night was serious, his condition is still critical,&quot; Dr Avtar said while speaking to media on Tuesday.Meanwhile, protesting farmers have condemned the Centre&#039;s stance on the issue so far and warned that the situation will be uncontrollable if anything happens to Dallewal.&quot;Jagjit Dalewal has been on a fast for 43 days to get the promises made to farmers fulfilled, but PM Modi is not affected. If something happens to Jagjit Dalewal, farmers will be so angry that the situation will spiral out of control and the central government would not be able to do anything about it,&quot; said a farmer&#039;s representative.Around 30,000 farmers from Akola district of Maharashtra have sent signatures in favour of the MSP demand, he added.2021 TRACTOR MARCH BY FARMERSOn January 26, 2021, thousands of farmers protesting against controversial agricultural reforms stormed Delhi&#039;s historic Red Fort, turning the Republic Day celebrations into a scene of chaos. The protest escalated after a clash between farmers and police, leading to widespread disruption.Protesters scaled the walls of the iconic monument and unfurled a flag alongside India&#039;s national flag, drawing sharp criticism and sparking a national debate.The farmers had planned their march to coincide with the Republic Day parade to amplify their grievances against the three farm laws enacted by the central government in September 2021.While the government argued that the laws were crucial to modernising India&#039;s agricultural sector, farmers feared that the reforms would favour large corporations, allowing them to dictate crop prices and pushing small-scale farmers into financial distress.With inputs from Kulveer SinghPublished By: Vivek Published On: Jan 8, 2025ALSO READ |  Punjab AAP leaders meet Jagjit Dallewal, extend support to farmersMust Watch'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":15}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import html"],"metadata":{"id":"qosavm4oMQzG"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def decode_html_entities(text):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Convert HTML entities and special characters in the input text to plain text.\n","    Handles common HTML entities like &amp;#039;, &amp;lsquo;, &amp;rsquo;, &amp;quot;, &amp;amp;, etc.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    if not isinstance(text, str):\n","        return text\n","    return html.unescape(html.unescape(text))\n","\n","\n","df['content'] = df['content'].apply(decode_html_entities)"],"metadata":{"id":"pZmyu6lILOfq"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.to_csv(\"df_edited_1.csv\", index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"xlsRRB6NMR51"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **2nd Editing**"],"metadata":{"id":"0YlNqDEiRVJp"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df = pd.read_csv('df_edited_1.csv')"],"metadata":{"id":"JBB5aWZfRd4C"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.sample(10)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":363},"id":"AiPWb3aHRqkO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747570098972,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":49,"user":{"displayName":"Swarnava Banerjee","userId":"14306795758291478459"}},"outputId":"15c413fb-24d7-43ed-9f7b-78114a64b8b9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                  title              source  \\\n","506   Chandigarh Farmers Protest: Farmers to protest...

Key alliance members such as NCP (SP) and TMC have endorsed the petition.Gogoi said RTI Act's Section 8(1) states that if somebody seeks personal information, which has no public interest in it, that information can be withheld. But, in case the information is relevant in public interest, it cannot be withheld even if it means giving some personal information about someone, he said quoting the section.He claimed that Section 44(3), which undermines Section 8(1) of the RTI Act, says notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen information that relates to personal information.\",\n          \"Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who passed away at the age of 92 on Thursday, had earlier this year strongly condemned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's election campaign, accusing him of using hate speech and lowering the dignity of the Prime Minister's office.Manmohan Singh passed away on Thursday evening at AIIMS after suffering a sudden loss of consciousness. The nation bids farewell to a statesman whose legacy will continue to influence Indian politics for years to come.\\u201cModi ji has indulged in the most vicious form of hate speeches, which are purely divisive in nature. Modi ji is the first prime minister to lower the dignity of public discourse, and thereby the gravity of the office of the prime minister, Singh stated in a letter released on May 30.Read Also | Manmohan Singh: One surprising phone call in 1991 that changed India's economyThe Congress supremo also took aim at PM Modi\\u2019s campaign narrative, specifically the false claims attributed to him. He has also attributed some false statements to me. I have never in my life singled out one community from the other. That is the sole copyright of the BJP,\\u201d he wrote, categorically denying the allegations made during the election period. Agnipath Scheme & economic woes: A threat to nationalSingh sharply criticised the Agnipath scheme, a controversial military recruitment program under the Modi government. He argued that the four-year service term discouraged youth from joining the armed forces and endangered national security. The Agniveer scheme endangers national security. The Congress party has therefore promised to abolish the Agniveer scheme, Singh declared.The former Prime Minister didn\\u2019t hold back on the economic front either, highlighting the disastrous impact of the BJP government's policies. He lambasted the handling of demonetisation, the flawed Goods and Services Tax (GST), and the mismanagement during the COVID-19 pandemic.Read Also | Manmohan Singh: When Parliament debate turned into Sharyai Jugalbandi between former PM and Sushma Swaraj; Watch video The imposition of the demonetisation disaster, a flawed GST, and the painful mismanagement during the COVID pandemic has resulted in a miserable situation, where an expectation of a subpar 6-7 per cent GDP growth has become the new normal. Average GDP Growth under BJP Government has plunged to under 6 per cent, while during Congress-UPA tenure, it was about 8 per cent (New Series), wrote the ex PM and Union Finance Minister. While the Congress-UPA, despite challenges, increased the purchasing power of our people, the misrule of the BJP Government has resulted in depletion of household savings to a historic 47-year low. Rural wages have witnessed a systematic fall, and wage disparity has led to widespread distress, noted Singh in the letter. BJP\\u2019s hostility toward Punjab & farmersSingh's letter also lashed out at the BJP's treatment of Punjab and its farmers, particularly during the farmer protests. He attacked the BJP for targeting Punjab, Punjabis, and the concept of Punjabiyat, referring to the tragic deaths of 750 farmers.\\u201cIn the past ten years, the BJP government has left no stone unturned in castigating Punjab, Punjabis and Punjabiyat. 750 farmers, mostly belonging to Punjab, were martyred while incessantly waiting at Delhi borders, for months together. As if the lathis and the rubber bullets were not enough, none less than the Prime Minister verbally assaulted our farmers by calling them Andolanjeevis and Parjeevi (Parasites) on the floor of the Parliament. Their only demand was the withdrawal of the three farm laws imposed on them without consulting them, Singh wrote.Read Also | A big loss to the nation: PM Modi pays tribute to Dr. Manmohan SinghThe ex PM took a firm stance against Modi's narrative of division, particularly when the Prime Minister accused him of saying that Muslims had the first right to the country's resources.

A Bench of Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud and Justice J B Pardiwala recorded Attorney General R Venkataramani\\u2019s statement in its order adjourning the proceedings. \\u201cLearned Attorney General states that in pursuance of the order dated May 11, 2022, the government has initiated the process of re-examining the provisions of Section 124A of IPC and consultations are at substantially advanced stage. In view of the above statement and on the request of the Attorney General, we direct that these proceedings may be posted in the second week of August,\\u201d the Bench said. AG Venkataramani told the Bench that the process was on and \\u201conce it is finalised before it goes to Parliament, probably they will come back to me about what exactly (is) the shape of the provision to come\\u201d. As the Bench agreed to adjourn the hearing to know the government stance, the AG requested that it may be fixed for hearing in August, saying \\u201cthe government is also very keen to push it as early as possible\\u201d and \\u201cin the monsoon session, probably something may happen\\u201d. Earlier, during the hearing, some of the petitioner counsel said the court may have to refer the matter to a seven-judge constitution bench in view of the observations in the 1962 Kedar Nath Singh judgment. A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court had in that case, while upholding Section 124A, tried to prevent its misuse by laying down what amounts to sedition and what does not. Responding to the petitions challenging the sedition law, the Centre had in May 2022 told the apex court that it is \\u201cfully cognizant of the various views\\u201d on the subject and \\u201chas decided to re-examine and re-consider the provisions of Section 124A\\u201d. It urged the bench to defer the hearing on petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the law until such exercise is carried out \\u201cbefore an appropriate forum\\u201d. It also urged the court to defer the hearing until the time the exercise is completed. Taking the government stand on record, a three-judge bench presided by the then CJI N V Ramana had on May 11, 2022, put on hold trial in all sedition cases pending before courts across the country until the government completes its promised exercise \\u201cto re-examine and re-consider the provisions of Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code\\u201d dealing with the offence. Referring to the government stand, the court order had further said \\u201cit is clear that the Union of India agrees with the prima facie opinion expressed by this court that the rigours of Section 124A of IPC is not in tune with the current social milieu, and was intended for a time when this country was under the colonial regime. In light of the same, the Union of India may reconsider the aforesaid provision of law\\u201d. The court said it is \\u201ccognizant of the security interests and integrity of the State on one hand, and the civil liberties of citizens on the other\\u201d. \\u201cThere is a requirement to balance both sets of considerations, which is a difficult exercise. The case of the petitioners is that this provision of law dates back to 1898, and pre-dates the Constitution itself, and is being misused,\\u201d it had said. The bench pointed out that the then Attorney General K K Venugopal, too, had \\u201con an earlier date of hearing, given some instances of glaring misuse of this provision, like in the case of recital of the Hanuman Chalisa (slapping sedition charges against two legislators in Maharashtra over recital of the prayer)\\u201d. \\u201cTherefore, we expect that, till the re-examination of the provision is complete, it will be appropriate not to continue the usage of the aforesaid provision of law by the governments,\\u201d the May 11 order said.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.loc[20, 'content']"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":765},"id":"otI0vatBR5sP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747570105874,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":47,"user":{"displayName":"Swarnava Banerjee","userId":"14306795758291478459"}},"outputId":"4906c3cb-7716-4e9a-fc48-f2bd323a0ee0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'When Julius Caesar\\'s Senate fixed January 1 as the ‘first day of the year\\', the idea wasn\\'t only to ‘start afresh\\'.

In that tradition, coming down from 45 BC, let the existing coalition government headed by Narendra Modi set out to focus and do a lot better with this list: Top 25 Must Get Done In 2025.1. Control inflation: Retail inflation reached a 14-month high of 6.21% and food inflation reached a 15-month high of 10.87% in October 2024. In 2023, savings by households dipped to a 50-year low.2. Make the GDP grow: The Reserve Bank of India reduced GDP growth estimates from 7.2% to 6.6% in December 2024. The repo rate was not cut for eleven consecutive terms.3. Attract foreign investment: 13 thousand crore (1.6 billion USD) worth of foreign direct investment has decreased between 2022-23 and 2023-24.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");4. Make the rupee strong: In December 2024, the rupee stayed weak for the third straight session and settled at an all-time low of 85.27 against the US dollar.5. Generate employment: Youth unemployment rate has been at 10% for the last two years. As per the Economic Survey, half of all individuals are not ready to be employed after graduating from college.6. Favour the common man: In the last four years, Rs 5.65 lakh crore has been written off for the industrial sector. Agriculture, the largest employer in the country, received the least attention in terms of loan write-offs among all sectors from Scheduled Commercial Banks.7. Provide food for all: Annually, 17 lakh Indians die from diseases related to insufficient food intake.8. Ensure equal wages for all: Annual growth rate of real wages over the last decade has been close to zero at the all-India level. Rural real wages for the last five years have declined at 0.4% and agricultural wages have become stagnant at 0.2%. Four out of five people earn less than Rs 515 as of 2021.9. Ensure dignity of life for farmers: As per the NCRB, 30 farmers commit suicide every day. Since February 2024, 22 farmers have lost their lives and over 160 have been injured while protesting for a legal guarantee for MSP.10. Enable safety for women: Section 63 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita deals with the offence of rape but provides an exception for marital rape, stating that “sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under eighteen years of age, is not rape”.11. Ensure dignity for the marginalised: Between 2018 and 2020, 443 people died cleaning sewers and septic tanks. Manual scavenging was banned in 2013.12. Protect the press: Between 2014 and 2019, there were 200 serious attacks on journalists, along with arrests and interrogations. At least 194 journalists were targeted by government agencies, non-state political actors, criminals, and armed opposition groups in 2022 alone.13. Ensure equitable representation: The representation of women in the 18th Lok Sabha is merely 13.6%. This is even less than the 17th Lok Sabha, which had 14.4% women. Only two out of 24 Parliamentary Standing Committees are chaired by women.14. Allow legislative scrutiny: Since 2019, over 100 bills have been passed in less than two hours. In the 17th Lok Sabha, nine out of 10 bills introduced in Parliament have been marked by zero or incomplete consultations.15. Select the Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha: The 17th Lok Sabha did not have a Deputy Speaker for its entire five-year term. The office of the Deputy Speaker continues to remain vacant even in the 18th Lok Sabha.16. Allow criticism: The number of opposition MPs who have been suspended in the last five years has increased 13-fold. As many as 95% cases by the Enforcement Directorate in the last ten years have been filed against those from the Opposition.17. Respect institutions: The National Commission for Backward Classes, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights do not have a Vice-Chairperson.18. Support Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes & Other Backward Classes: As of March 2024, one out of 10 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBV) were not functional. Two out of five Eklavya schools were not functional as of July 2024.19. Complete timelines: The 2021 Census has still not been conducted. This makes it the first Census to be delayed between 1887 and 2011.20. Utilise funds better: As much as 80% of the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao\\'s total fund was spent on media advocacy, not for interventions on health or education.21. Release dues owed to states: The government owes Rs 1,500 Crore under MGNREGS and Awas Yojana to West Bengal. The non-payment of the funds has directly affected the livelihood of 59 lakh MGNREGS workers.22. Care about Manipur: The violence in Manipur has continued for more than a year, causing the displacement of 67,000 people, of which 14,000 are school-going students. The Prime Minister is yet to visit the state.23. Safeguard minorities and their welfare: The NCRB recorded 378 instances of communal violence in 2021 and 272 such instances in 2022. In 2023, India witnessed 668 documented hate speech incidents against one community alone. One hundred and twenty-eight properties were demolished between April and June 2022, following communal violence and protests.24. Build secure public infrastructure: There were 244 train accidents between 2017 and 2022. As many as 135 people died when a suspension bridge collapsed in Morbi.
